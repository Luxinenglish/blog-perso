# Analysis of Vulnerability: npm Supply Chain Attack (September 2025)

## üîç Technical Description

In September 2025, a large-scale supply chain attack targeted the npm ecosystem, the most widely used JavaScript package manager. The campaign, nicknamed "Shai-Hulud," involved injecting malicious code into over 600 versions of nearly 200 npm packages, including popular libraries such as `@ctrl/tinycolor`, `ngx-bootstrap`, `chalk`, `debug`, and `@crowdstrike`.

The attackers leveraged self-propagating methods by exploiting `postinstall` scripts to steal authentication tokens (npm, GitHub, AWS, GCP) and exfiltrate secrets through webhooks and malicious GitHub Actions ([security.snyk.io](https://security.snyk.io/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack-sep-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Propagation was facilitated through compromised maintainer accounts, often gained via targeted phishing campaigns. Once a maintainer account was compromised, the malware self-replicated by modifying packages maintained by the attacker, making the attack particularly virulent and hard to contain ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/npm-supply-chain-attack/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## üìä Impact and Severity

This attack is one of the largest and most sophisticated ever observed in the npm ecosystem. It compromised packages downloaded billions of times per week, affecting critical applications in web development, cloud infrastructure, and cryptography.

Consequences included theft of authentication secrets, CI/CD pipeline compromise, exfiltration of sensitive data, and propagation of backdoors in production environments ([trendmicro.com](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/npm-supply-chain-attack.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## üõ°Ô∏è Affected Products

Compromised npm packages included:

- `ngx-bootstrap` (versions 18.1.4 to 20.0.6)
- `@ctrl/tinycolor` (versions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2)
- `chalk`, `debug`, `ansi-styles`, `strip-ansi`
- Packages under namespaces `@crowdstrike`, `@nativescript-community`, `@ctrl`
- `ng2-file-upload`

These packages are widely used in both open-source projects and enterprise applications, amplifying the scale of the attack ([snyk.io](https://snyk.io/blog/embedded-malicious-code-in-tinycolor-and-ngx-bootstrap-releases-on-npm/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

To protect against this attack and prevent future compromises:

1. **Audit dependencies**: Use tools like Snyk, Sonatype, or GitHub Security Advisory Database to identify compromised packages in your projects.
2. **Update packages**: Ensure all dependencies are up to date and remove any compromised versions.
3. **Strengthen authentication**: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for all npm and GitHub accounts, and use access tokens with limited scope.
4. **Secure CI/CD pipelines**: Review GitHub Actions workflows and other pipelines for any unauthorized or suspicious activity.
5. **Train teams**: Educate developers about phishing risks and secure coding practices.
6. **Monitor activity**: Implement monitoring tools to detect abnormal activity or attempts to exfiltrate data.
